    <h2>Who is requesting user data?</h2>
    <p>
      At Bullet Journal, we collect and manage user data according to the following Privacy Policy, with the goal of
      incorporating our product values: transparency, accessibility, sanity, usability. By using <a
        href="//bulletjournal.us">bulletjournal.us</a>, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Please read the
      Privacy Policy entirety, and refer to
      those for definitions and contacts.
    </p>
    <h2>What information do we collect?</h2>
    <p>1. When you give it to us or give us permission to obtain it
      When you sign up for or use Bullet Journal, you voluntarily share certain information including your username,
      email address, photos, and any other information you give us. You can also choose to share your precise location
      using your device settings or through photos. We will still use your IP address, which is used to approximate your
      location, even if you don't choose to share your precise location. You will also have the option to share other
      information about yourself such as your preferred language.
      If you connect your Facebook, Google(opens in a new window) or other third-party accounts to Bullet Journal, we
      use information from those accounts (such as your google calendar information) to improve your Bullet Journal
      experience. This is dependent on the privacy policies or settings for those accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. We also get technical information when you use Bullet Journal
      When you use a website, mobile application or other internet service, certain internet and electronic network
      activity information gets created and logged automatically. This is also true when you use Bullet Journal. Here
      are some of the types of information we collect:
      Log data. When you use Bullet Journal, our servers record information (“log data”), including information that
      your browser automatically sends whenever you visit a website, or that your mobile app automatically sends when
      you’re using it. This log data includes your Internet Protocol address (which we use to infer your approximate
      location), the address of and activity on websites you visit that incorporate Bullet Journal features (like the
      “Save” button—more details below), searches, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, how you
      used Bullet Journal, cookie data and device data. You can learn more about the log data we collect here.
      Cookie data. We also use “cookies” (small text files sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique
      to your Bullet Journal account or your browser) or similar technologies to get log data. When we use cookies or
      other similar technologies, we use session cookies (that last until you close your browser) or persistent cookies
      (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, we use cookies to store your language preferences
      or other settings so you don‘t have to set them up every time you visit Bullet Journal. Some of the cookies we use
      are associated with your Bullet Journal account (including information about you, such as the email address you
      gave us) and other cookies are not. For more detailed information about how we use cookies, please review our
      Cookie Policy(opens in a new window).
      Device information. In addition to log data, we collect information about the device you’re using Bullet Journal
      on, including the type of device, operating system, settings, unique device identifiers and crash data that helps
      us understand when something breaks.
      Clickstream data and inferences. When you’re on Bullet Journal, we use your activity—such as which Pins you click
      on, boards you create, and any text that you add in a comment or description—along with information you provided
      when you first signed up and information from our partners and advertisers to make inferences about you and your
      preferences. For example, if you create a board about travel, we may infer you are a travel enthusiast. We may
      also infer information about your education or professional experience based on your activity when you link your
      account to accounts you have with third parties like Facebook or Google.
    </p>

    <p>3. Our partners and advertisers share information with us
      We also get information about you and your activity outside Bullet Journal from our affiliates, advertisers,
      partners and other third parties we work with. For example:
      Some websites or apps use Bullet Journal features such as our “Save” button, or you may install our “Save” button
      for your browser. If so, we collect log data from those sites or apps. You can learn more about these features at
      our Help Center.
      Online advertisers or third parties share information with us to measure, report on or improve the performance of
      ads on Bullet Journal, or to figure out what kinds of ads to show you on or off of Bullet Journal. This includes
      information about your visits to an advertiser's site or purchases you made from them, or information about your
      interests from a third-party service, which we might use to help show you ads. Learn more about the types of
      information advertisers or other third parties share with us.
